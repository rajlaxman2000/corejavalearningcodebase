1.	Given the Java declarations
interface I { void foo(); }

 
and
 


class B extends A implements I { ... }
 

which of the following statements is true? Circle one:

(i) Class B must provide a defnition for foo(), no matter how class A is defined. (ii) Class B only needs to provide a definition of foo() if A does not.
(iii) Class B only needs to provide a definition of foo() if A does not implement I.

(iv) Class B inherits foo() from I, thus B does not have to provide a definition of
foo().

(i)	T(x, y);  (ii)  this(x, y); (iii) super(x, y); (iv) super(x, y, z);

public class T {
	int r;
	int s;
	T(int x, int y) {
		r = x;
		s = y;
	}
}

class S extends T {
	int t;
	public S(int x, int y, int z){
	
		// insert here the code
		// that would do the correct initialization
		// r= x and s= y t=z;
	}
}


Class Test{
	public void main(Stting[] args){
		S s =new S(1,2,3);
	}
}
